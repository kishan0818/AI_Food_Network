Build a fully functional, interactive, and visually stunning prototype for the AI Food Waste-to-Hunger Network. The website should feel like an AI-powered community platform that connects surplus food to people in need — combining food aesthetics, community warmth, and cutting-edge AI visuals.

Core Goals:

A balance of human warmth (community, food imagery) and high-tech feel (AI patterns, predictive dashboards).

Professional, colorful design using green (sustainability), yellow/orange (food & warmth), blue (technology & trust).

Engaging micro-interactions (hover effects, subtle glows, icon animations).

Fully responsive on all devices.

Pages & Interactive Features:

Home / Dashboard Page

Hero section with AI-generated background video blending food rescue scenes + digital network visuals (flowing lines, predictive data overlays).

Animated tagline: “Turning surplus into sustenance — using AI to make cities not just smarter, but kinder.” (fade-in word by word).

Live Statistics Dashboard (mock AI predictions):

Meals delivered today

Food rescued (kg)

CO₂ emissions saved

Three quick CTA cards:

“Report Surplus Food” (restaurant icon)

“Find Food Nearby” (map pin + basket)

“Partner With Us” (handshake icon)

Problem & Solution Page

Scroll-based storytelling: problem appears in sepia-toned images of waste & hunger, which then transition into colorful, hopeful solution visuals.

Features with AI-inspired visuals (neural network lines, animated predictive graphs):

Predicting Surplus

Instant Connections

Optimized Delivery

Fair Distribution

Transparency

Impact Page

Animated infographics showing environmental, social, and economic benefits.

Hovering over a card reveals deeper AI predictions for that metric.

Use food-themed icons (leaf for environment, bread for social, coin for economic).

Get Involved Page

Warm, inviting images of volunteers, chefs, and communities.

Role-based sign-up form: NGO, Restaurant, Volunteer, Donor.

Newsletter with “AI Weekly Insights” on food rescue.

UI & Design Requirements:

Framework: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.

Colors:

Primary Green (#3CB371) — sustainability

Warm Orange (#FFA500) — food warmth

Blue (#007ACC) — AI trust

Fonts: modern sans-serif with rounded edges (approachable yet professional).

Shapes: soft cards with rounded corners, shadow depth.

Backgrounds: subtle AI neural network animations and food textures (e.g., grain patterns, wooden boards).

Navbar: sticky, with a glowing underline on hover.

Buttons: gradient backgrounds (green-to-orange), smooth hover scaling.

Technical Notes:

Dummy JSON data for live stats and food listings.

Mock integration points for AI surplus predictions.

Optimized images for performance.

SEO-ready meta tags.

Deployable on Vercel instantly.

Deliverables:

Fully interactive, multi-page, polished prototype.

Food + AI + society theme consistently visible across design.

Placeholder content clearly marked for later replacement.
